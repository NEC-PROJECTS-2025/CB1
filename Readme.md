### INTRODUCTION
Pests are a big problem for farmers, as they can damage crops and reduce food production. Traditional methods to control pests are not always accurate and can harm the environment. This project uses a deep learning model called VGG16 to detect different types of pests more accurately. The goal is to help farmers identify pests quickly and manage them in a better, more eco-friendly way.
